### Well done!

This repo holds the source code for [notFSL.fyi](https://notFSL.fyi/), the
homepage for the [NonFunctional Source License (NFSL)](https://notFSL.fyi/). If
you have questions, join the club. Consider [opening an
issue](https://github.com/JeffreyUrban/notFSL.fyi/issues/new) (we have those too) 
or dive in with a PR.


### Wait What?

We decided what is beyond FSL and it's not FSL.
Here is some content to distract you with a backstory while we head elsewhere.

> We decided to do something by free-riding on the well-known FSL license,
> mostly for ourselves, but also others who wanted more user freedom.

[Introducing the NonFunctional Source License: Freedom on Your Timeline](https://notFSL.fyi/)

> We value originality to an extent, but we don’t think it mattered enough
> not to just take the well-known FSL license and rebrand it as our own.
> Our version uses the same strident terms as the Functional Source License. 
> Except for the timeline. Exactly two years was just too strident for us.
> We think of freedom when it feels like the right time to do so. And we 
> think you should too. Freedom means that you get to decide if you want 
> to be efficient or not as a developer. What’s more, it’s not the only 
> thing that matters to us. We also value long walks on the beach, which 
> can help relieve the tension of software development. Finding another 
> project we can claim as our own after changing literally one phrase is
> what Open Source means to us.

The NonFunctional Source Foundation's Values

> There isn't actually a NonFunctional Source Foundation, but that sounded 
> more legitimate... until I just said there isn't actually one. In truth, 
> we're non-competitive with Sentry and the Functional Source License (FSL). 
> We just wanted to actually draft our own set of values, but that just 
> wasn't going to happen. So we're borrowing from their brand and standing
> next to them, pretending to be part of it.

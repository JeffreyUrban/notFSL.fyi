          <p>
            The NonFunctional Source License (NFSL) is a
            <a href="https://fair.io/">Fair Source</a>
            license that converts to Apache 2.0 or MIT after a duration you
            specify. It is designed for SaaS companies that value both user
            freedom and developer sustainability, but also value choosing their
            own timeline more than they value originality. NFSL provides
            everything a developer needs to use and learn from your software
            without

            <a href="https://fsl.software/">Functional Source License</a> by
            copying it and changing the fixed two year timeline to be
            whatever duration you want.

        <div class="content">
          <h2>How exactly does the timeline work?</h2>

          <p>
            The timeframe you specify applies to each software version that is
            made available. Methods of making software available include
            pushing a Git commit, publishing a package to a repository,
            mailing out a CD in a tin, or casting to sea the code as a bottled message.
          </p>

          <h3>Specifying the Timeline Duration</h3>

          <p>
            Use of the NFSL requires you to use the following format syntax to specify the <code>duration</code> parameter, for use in the template, that determines how soon your software automatically converts to the permissive future license (MIT or Apache 2.0).
          </p>

          <h3>Duration Format Syntax</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Format:</strong> <code>duration: &lt;integer&gt; &lt;unit&gt;[ &lt;integer&gt; &lt;unit&gt;]*</code> where <code>unit</code> is: <code>years</code>, <code>months</code>, <code>weeks</code>, <code>days</code>
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Each <code>&lt;integer&gt;</code> must be a positive whole number</li>
            <li>Units can be singular or plural (<code>1 year</code> or <code>2 years</code>)</li>
            <li>Multiple units can be combined with spaces</li>
            <li>When this format definition is followed precisely, it is compatible with git's <code>--before</code> option for practical verification, and can be used in an NFSL license.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Duration Examples</h3>

          <p>Single unit durations:</p>

          <p>
            <code>2 years</code><br>
            <code>18 months</code><br>
            <code>90 days</code><br>
            <code>12 weeks</code><br>
            <code>1 year</code><br>
            <code>36 months</code>
          </p>

          <p>Mixed unit durations:</p>

          <p>
            <code>1 year 6 months</code><br>
            <code>2 years 3 months</code><br>
            <code>1 year 3 months 2 weeks</code><br>
            <code>3 years 6 months</code>
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="git-verification">
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Verifying License Conversion with Git</h2>

          <p>
            The git-compatible duration format enables a practical workflow for users to verify which versions of your code have converted to the permissive license:
          </p>

          <pre><code># For a project licensed as NFSL with "2 years" duration
git clone &lt;repository&gt;
git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="2 years ago" main`
# If LICENSE.md is NFSL, you can now use this version under MIT or Apache 2.0

# For a project with "18 months" duration
git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="18 months ago" main`

# For a project with "1 year 6 months" duration
git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="1 year 6 months ago" main`</code></pre>

          <p>
            This allows anyone to easily identify and use versions of your software that have automatically transitioned to open source licensing. Just like FSL, but with your own timeline. You
              know, that thing we changed.

            <dt>Why?</dt>

            <dd>
              Many SaaS companies wish to make the source code for their core
              products available under
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license"
                >permissive</a

                >harmful free-riding</a
              >. Having yet another license for this purpose to choose from makes life a bit more
              difficult for both
              producers and consumers of such software.
            </dd>
              <p></p>

            <dd style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png" alt="XKCD Standards" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
            </dd>

            <dt>What is harmful free-riding?</dt>

            <dd>
              Harmful free-riding is the sort of free-riding that leads to
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
                >the free-rider problem</a
              >: “We benefited from the FSL's resources,
              but did not pay for them, or maybe we
              under-paid since we did a free trial of Sentry. Regardless, our contribution
              may be under-produced, overused, or degraded vs FSL.
              Despite aspirations to be cooperative (a prosocial behaviour),
              we're free-riders perpetuating the free-rider problem.”
            </dd>

            <dt>Why not Open Source?</dt>
            <dd>
              <a href="https://opensource.org/osd/">Open Source</a> does not
              protect against harmful free-riding. Also, we wanted to free-ride
              on Sentry's FSL instead.

                We decided what was
              beyond FSL is not being constrained to exactly two years - a
              one-size-fits-all timeline that felt unnecessarily strident to us. So
              we borrowed FSL's excellent but persnickety work and revolutionized
              the licensing landscape by changing one very impactful parameter.
              Creating a new revolutionary project by changing
              literally one parameter is what Open Source means to us; but software
              licensed by this or FSL are not open source, so go figure.
            </dd>

            <dt>What about AGPLv3 though?</dt>
            <dd>
              <a href="https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3/">AGPLv3</a>
              is not permissive enough. As a highly viral copyleft license, it
              exposes users to serious risk of having to divulge their
              proprietary source code. NFSL does not introduce this risk, so NFSL
              software can be adopted at organizations where AGPL is outside of
              policy.
            </dd>

            <dt>Why not open core?</dt>
            <dd>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model"
                >Open core</a
              >
              is not permissive enough. It restricts based on feature set, such
              that some product features are <i>never</i> open. Moreover, the
              percentage of features that are restricted is highly variable from
              product to product. With NFSL, all product features are available
              now for almost all uses, and are soon fully permissive.
            </dd>

            <dt>Why not [some other alternative]?</dt>

            <dd>
              We just asked our LLM assistant what license we should use, and it
              recommended FSL, but we just couldn't come to terms with the fixed
              two-year duration. We've made similar attempts over the decades to
              find a license. None has truly caught on with us, and we knew we
              would outright abandon any we tried that we didn't create ourselves.

              <br /><br />

              NFSL's immediate predecessor is obviously the
              <a href="https://fsl.software/">Functional Source License</a>
              (FSL), which itself evolved from the
              <a href="https://mariadb.com/bsl11/">Business Source License</a>
              (BSL or BUSL). FSL's time-based approach is great, and we borrowed
              their originality. Each NFSL implementation is essentially the
              same license — we just let you pick your own duration instead of
              dictating exactly two years. NFSL is FSL with one parameter
              changed. That's the innovation, and it's transformative.
            </dd>

            <dt>What can I do with NFSL software?</dt>

            <dd>
              You can do anything with NFSL software except undermine its
              producer. You can run it for almost all purposes, study it, modify
              it, and distribute your changes, including proposing improvements
              back to the producer. After the duration specified in the license
              (which the producer gets to choose, unlike FSL's rigid
              two years), it becomes permissive Open Source software under
              Apache 2.0 or MIT.
            </dd>

            <dt>Why only Apache 2.0 and MIT?</dt>

            <dd>
              Because FSL chose these we assume for good reason and we didn't
              want to expend energy thinking for ourselves.
            </dd>

            <dt>
              Okay, but I can use NFSL with a different change license, right?
            </dt>

            <dd>
              No. If you do this, you'll have to call it something other than
              NFSL. We're already pushing it by taking FSL and changing one
              thing - if you change the target license too, just use the
              <a href="https://mariadb.com/bsl11/">Business Source License</a>
              directly. It's similar to NFSL (and FSL) but allows for any
              change license.
            </dd>

            <dt>What's with the name?</dt>
            <dd>It's like FSL, but less functional in standardizing the community.
                <p>It's NonFunctional. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></dd>

            <dt>What's the backstory?</dt>
            <dd>
              We read
              <a
                href="https://blog.sentry.io/introducing-the-functional-source-license-freedom-without-free-riding/"
                >Sentry's FSL announcement</a
              >, thought "this is great but exactly two years feels restrictive," and
              decided to free-ride on their excellent work by making that one
              thing configurable. That's it.
            </dd>

            <dt>How do I adopt NFSL for my product?</dt>
            <dd>
